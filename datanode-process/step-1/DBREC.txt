"The original dataset, including more than 39,000 resources, 
included 3,004,351 triples. We then cleaned it to get a smaller and more accurate dataset, "

0) having data with 39,000 resources and 3,004,351 triples >> access, Data, 39000, Resource, 3004351, Triple
1) clean it to make it smaller and accurate >> clean, reduce, cure

"for two main reasons. On the one hand, we wanted to remove datatype properties, 
as they are not relevant for our experiment6. Removing them lead to a dataset containing 
2,247,019 triples, thus reducing the original one from about 25.2% — implying that 1/4 of 
DBpedia assertions, in our dataset, involve literals. "

0) having data_1 with 39,000 resources and 3,004,351 triples >> access, Data, 39000, Resource, 3004351, Triple
1) remove datatype properties because they are not relevant >> remove, DatatypeProperty, Irrelevant
2) having data_2 with 2,247,019 triples >> access, 2247019, Triple
3) data_2 is a portion of data_1 >> Data, Portion
4) data_2 is 25.2% smaller then data_1 >> Data, 25.2%, Small, SmallerThen

"On the other hand, we identified 
lots of redundancy and inconsistencies in our DBpedia subset7. Especially, many links 
between resources are defined redundantly as http://dbpedia.org/ontology/xxx and at the 
same time as http://dbpedia.org/property/xxx. We then removed duplicates, leading to 
1,675,711 triples, i.e. only 55.7% of the original dataset."

0) having data with redundancies and inconsistencies >> access, Data, Redundancy, Inconsistency
1) remove redundancies >> remove, Redundancy
2) remove inconsistencies >> remove, Inconsistency
3) remove duplicates (same as redundancies?) >> remove, Duplicate
4) data is now 55.7 percent of before >> Data, 55.7%, Now, Before

"We also analysed the dataset to identify how artists are related to each other (by direct links) 
in DBpedia (Fig. 4). We observed that 21,211 of them (more than 50%) are not linked to any artists, 
and 9,555 are linked to three of them, the maximum being 14 links from one artist to 14 others. 
Then, by using indirect links for computing semantic distance with LDSD, we are able to provide 
recommendations for these 21,211 isolated artists."

0) having dbpedia >> access, Dbpedia
1) identify artists >> identify, Artist
2) identify links between artists >> identify, Link, Artist, Between
3) compute the number of links for each artist >> compute, Number, Link, Each, Artist
4) the artists with no links are more then 50%, ie 21.211 >> Artist, Without, Link, MoreThen, 50%
5) the artists with three links are 9,555 >> Artist, 3, Link, 9555
6) the maximum number of links is 14 >> Max, Number, Link, 14
7) identify indirect links between artists >> identify, Indirect, Link, Between, Artist


"We then focused on further optimisations not at the query-engine level, but at the dataset level, 
analysing it more deeply, and we identified that: (1) 188 distinct properties are used to link artists 
together directly; (2) 578 distinct properties are used to link an artist to any resource (including artists) ;
 (3) 767 distinct properties are used to link any resource (including artists) to an artist. "

0) optimize the dataset for the task >> optimize, Dataset, Task
1) identify the distinct properties used to link artists directly >> identify, Distinct, Property, Link, Artist, Direct
2) there are 578 distinct properties that link artists directly >> 578, Distinct, Property, Link, Direct
3) identify the distinct properties used to link artists to any other resource >> identify, Distinct, Property, Link, Artist, Resource, AnyOther
4) 767 distinct properties are used to link artists to any other resource >> 767, Distinct, Property, Link, Artist, AnyOther, Resource

" We then focused on data curation: (1) on the one hand to remove properties and property-values 
 that are useless for computing the LDSD measures, and (2) on the other hand, to solve some data quality issues in DBpedia."

0) cure the data for the task >> cure, Data, Task
1) remove properties and property-values that are useless for computing LDSD measures >> remove, Property, PropertyValue, Useless, compute, LDSD, Measure, LDSDMeasure
2) solve some data quality issues >> solve, Data, Quality, Issue

"From the 188 properties linking two artists, we identified that 18 were used as links between 
artists while it was not their main purpose8, such as the property dbprop:notableInstruments — 
used to link an artist to its instrument(s) — or dbprop:nationalAnthem — linking a country to its anthem. "

0) having a dataset of artists and links between artists and things >> access, Dataset, Artist, Link, Thing
1) identify misused properties >> identify, Misuse, Property
2) 188 properties misused >> 188, Property, Misuse
3) the property dbprop:notableInstruments is misused in the dataset when/because it connects two artists >> Property, dbprop:notableInstruments, Misuse, Dataset, When, Link, Artist
4) the property dbprop:nationalAnthem is misused in the dataset when/because it connects a country to an artist >> Property, dbprop:nationalAnthem, Misuse, Dataset, When, Link, Country, Artist

"Moreover, we identified 35 properties that were wrongly defined — while however used two times of less —, 
such as http://dbpedia.org/property/extra18 and http://dbpedia.org/property/klfsgProperty. "

0) having a dataset which is a subset of dbpedia >> access, Dataset, Subset, Dbpedia
1) identify properties wrongly defined (lost data? meaningless data?) >> identify, Property, Wrong, Lost, Meaningless

"Then, from the 578 properties used to link artists to resources, 183 were used only one time and were 
consequently useless for our recommendations, since it imply there is no more than one artist using on. 
In addition, 36 of these properties were wrongly defined. "

0) having a dataset of artists and links to resources >> access, Dataset, Artist, Link, Resource
1) identify the properties used only once >> identify, Property, Usage, Once
2) 36 of the 37 properties used only ones are wrongly defined >> 36, 37, Property, Usage, Wrong

"Furthermore, we identified 11 useless property-value 
combinations to compute our recommendations, by being too generic such as rdf:type foaf:Agent. 
Finally, from the 767 properties used to link any resource to an artist, 336 were removed as 
used only to link to a single artist, and 115 were wrongly written."

0) having a dataset with artists and links to resources using 767 properties >> access, Dataset, Artist, Link, Resource, 767, Property
1) identify useless property-value combinations because too generic >> identify, Useless, PropertyValue, Combination, Because, TooGeneric
2) identify useless properties because used to link only to a single artist. They are 336, 115 of them are wrongly written. >> identify, Useless, Property, Because, Usage, Link, Single, Artist

" We then cleaned-up the dataset and reduced it to a total of 1,073,077 triples."

0) having dataset >> access, Dataset
1) cleaning the dataset >> clean, Dataset
2) the dataset is reduced to a total of 1,073,077 triples >> Dataset, reduce, Total, 1073077
