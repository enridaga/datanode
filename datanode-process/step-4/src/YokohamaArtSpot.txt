"It uses following three different datasets as data sources; LODAC Museum, Yokohama Art LOD and PinQA. [...]
PinQA is a social geographical Q&A service provided by NTT Resonant, Inc. that obtains and 
shares users Q&As corresponding to the specified geographical regions in a map. [...]
If a user takes an action, such as opening a new page that describes details about an institution, 
this is queried to the SPARQL endpoints of each LOD. The application then presents new 
information to the user using the data returned from the SPARQL endpoints. [...]
When a user accesses the application, a map view is presented, as shown in Fig. 3.
 This view gives users information on the kind of art they can experience by displaying institutions. 
 The locations of the current dayâ€™s events and Q&As related to the displayed area are also 
 presented on the map of Yokohama. [...]
In this map view, the name, address, and geographical coordinates of institutions 
to be presented are extracted from LODAC Museum with SPARQL using the latitudes and longitudes 
of the displayed area. As for the event information, the application obtains data for the events 
that would be held at those institutions included in the displayed area from Yokohama Art LOD using SPARQL."
