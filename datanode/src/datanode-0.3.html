<h3>Version 0.3</h3>
<p>The Datanode ontology was designed to describe data artifacts and their relations on the Semantic Web.</p>
<p>Datanode terms are under the <tt>http://purl.com/datanode/ns/</tt> namespace</p>

<p>Data is at the center of current developments on the World Wide Web. In
the Semantic Web, different kinds of data artifacts (datasets, catalogues, provenance 
metadata, etc.) are published, exchanged, described and queried every day. 
There are a number of use cases related to data hub management that 
can only be addressed if we are able to specify the relations between the managed data 
artifacts in a way that support useful inferences.</p> 
<p>Datanode is a conceptual framework designed to 
express relations between data nodes, implemented as an extendable OWL ontology 
covering the possible relationships between such data nodes. Datanode can support the management of (possibly distributed and interlinked) catalogues 
of web data and reasoning over the relationships between items in data catalogues.</p>
